A merge conflict occurred because my local repository and the remote repository at VCSTDN2024/xhaw5112-2025-st10098853Prelude had been initialized independently, each with unique commits. When attempting to push, Git required me to merge these unrelated histories. I resolved the conflict by reviewing both versions of the conflicting files, combining relevant changes, and committing the result. This ensures that both my local work and the remote repositoryâ€™s content are preserved and integrated.
