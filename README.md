# Sample Snack app

Open the `App.js` file to start writing some code. You can preview the changes directly on your phone or tablet by scanning the **QR code** or use the iOS or Android emulators. When you're done, click **Save** and share the link!

When you're ready to see everything that Expo provides (or if you want to use your own editor) you can **Download** your project and use it with [expo cli](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/#expo-cli)).

All projects created in Snack are publicly available, so you can easily share the link to this project via link, or embed it on a web page with the `<>` button.

A merge conflict occurred because my local repository and the remote repository at VCSTDN2024/xhaw5112-2025-st10098853Prelude had been initialized independently, each with unique commits. When attempting to push, Git required me to merge these unrelated histories. I resolved the conflict by reviewing both versions of the conflicting files, combining relevant changes, and committing the result. This ensures that both my local work and the remote repository’s content are preserved and integrated.
